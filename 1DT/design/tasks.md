# Explanation from the standard

## AS91878

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Develop a design for a digital outcome | Develop an informed design for a digital outcome | Develop an effective design for a digital outcome |

Developing a design for a digital outcome involves:

- defining the purpose and end users for the digital outcome
- researching and generating a range of design ideas
- selecting a chosen design, and describing the appropriateness of that chosen
- describing relevant implications

## AS91880

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Develop a digital media outcome | Develop an informed digital media outcome | Develop a refined digital media outcome |

Developing a digital media outcome involves:

- using appropriate tools, techniques and design elements for the purpose and end
users
- applying appropriate data integrity and testing procedures in the development of
the outcome
- describing relevant implications

## AS91884

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Use basic iterative processes to develop a digital outcome | Use basic iterative processes to develop an informed digital outcome |  Use basic iterative processes to develop a refined digital outcome |

Using basic iterative processes to develop a digital outcome involves:

- you apply appropriate tools, techniques and design elements in developing your digital media outcome
- you apply an iterative development process to improve and refine your digital media outcome. This includes trialling of the components of the outcome and improvement throughout the design, development and testing process.
- you have applied information from your planning, testing, and trialling of components to improve the quality of the outcome in the development of your outcome


# Time allowance

All work must be done your own.

Submission dates to be announced later in term 2.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

Create a website to promote a club, group, or cause at Onslow College.

You will need to:

- consider for which of the following you would like to develop a promotional website:
    - Onslow Enviro Group
    - Onslow College Kapa Haka group
    - Student well-being at Onslow College
    - another club/group/cause â€” you must have this approved with your teacher
- describe the purpose and target audience of the website **in detail**
- describe the implications relevant to your website and explain how the final design addresses them
- research the chosen club/group/cause's theme and find relevant design concepts that you will use in your design ideas, including:
    - website themes and trends
    - content hierarchy
    - typography (typefaces, kerning, leading, tracking)
    - layout and composition, arrangement, whitespace, alignment, contrast, repetition
    - colours, accessibility, and appropriateness of chosen colours
    - images, effective imagery for the purpose, image usage rights

You will do this in order to:

- generate a range of design ideas, taking into account the club/group/cause's theme, the target audience, and your research. As part of this, you will:
    - research relevant website designs and design ideas
    - complete a PMI (plus-minus-interesting) chart for each of at least three (3) researched websites
    - conduct font research and make a selection, clearly stating why it is fit for the purpose and end users
    - conduct colour scheme research and make a palette, clearly stating why it is fit for the purpose and end users
    - decide on the most effective means of presenting the information on the website by proposing a few layouts
        - this should include at least the index page and one other page typical of the rest of the design
- seek feedback from a variety of relevant people about your designs ideas
    - use the information you gather from them to inform the refinement of your design ideas into a single, final design
    - annotate your design ideas to explain what aspects were successful and which needed to be changed, and why
- justify the final design choice, considering the evidence you gained from feedback and research
- test that the website, created as per your design, functions as intended

## Specifications

The finalised design must contain:

- a site map showing the page hierarchy and navigation between pages
- wireframes (or scanned images of hand-draw diagrams) of the web page layouts
- mock-ups, based on the wireframes, showing how the layouts will look with your chosen font pairs and colour schemes
- colours, fonts, images, borders, etc. must be clearly shown
  - colours should be stated in hexadecimal or as rgb/hsl values
  - fonts should be stated according to their font family, weight, and size
- navigation should be clearly marked and hyperlinks must be clearly shown
- interactive elements (such as menus that only appear on hover) must be indicated with annotations

The website must contain:

- information and materials to promote a group/club/cause at Onslow College
- at least five pages, including:
    - a home page explaining what the website is about
    - easy-to-use navigation
    - relevant images that have been appropriately sourced

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this project are:

- a design portfolio, containing:
    1. the purpose of the website and target audience that you have identified
    2. an analysis of the relevant implications for your website
    3. analyses of your researched existing outcomes, including PMI charts for each
    4. a selection of font pairs and colour schemes
    5. a range of layout ideas
    6. evidence of refinement through testing, feedback, and further research
    7. a single, final design
    8. a justification of the final design, including:
       - how the design fulfils the purpose and meets end-user requirements
       - how the design addresses relevant implications
- a website, including:
    1. at least five pages
    2. the same design as you came up with during the design phase
    3. evidence of testing that the outcome continues to fulfil the purpose and meet end-user requirements
