Year 10 – HTML website design – Multi-page website Assessment – Advertising a Product, Service or Event

### Introduction

This assessment is split into 4 parts:
1.	Research
2.	Planning
3.	Construction
4.	Evaluation

### Overview

Windy Wellington Media is used by a range of organisations to create websites targeted at the New Zealand market. They are experts at tailoring the content and design to meet the unique cultural requirements of New Zealand people. WWM often approach potential clients by producing a concept and pitching it to the given company. WWM would like you to develop a prototype website for a product, Service or Event of your choice.

### Brief

You are required to make a multi-page website (at least 4 pages). Being a website aimed at the NZ market it should also be able to display these pages in English and Te Reo Maori (So 8 pages in total). Each page should be linked together and be accessible for any other page. 

The website must include the following, but the other pages are up to you, but should relate to the product, Service or Event.

1.	A home page – Introducing the product, Service or Event. 

2.	Gallery – Containing images, video and text that show the product, Service or Event being used/attended.

3.	Each page should have an English and Te Reo Maori option. You could do this by having an index page that askes for your language preference and then takes you to that version of the page, or having a button on each page to take you to the other language version of the page. 
Specifications

1.	The website must be coded to HTML 5 standards.
2.	The website must include links to cascading style sheets (CSS).
3.	The website must use correct syntax.

Technological Knowledge - Understand the properties of subsystems within technological systems.
Note: This is an open book assessment; you may use in-class work as well as information found online to help you complete the project. 
Students display understanding of how to apply various HTML and CSS tags (sub-systems) to create a fully functional website. A fully functional website uses a variety of content displayed in a visually pleasing and easy to read manor. All pages are linked together and all links work as intended. 

### Website Criteria:
a.	The website must be your own work
b.	The website must incorporate video, Images and text.
c.	You can use images found online to build your website. These should be altered as needed. 
d.	Your website should be designed with legibility in mind.
e.	Your website’s look and feel should relate to the content.
f.	The text content of each page must be displayed in English and Te Reo.
### Code Criteria:
a.	HTML & CSS tags are used.
b.	CSS is integrated in the most efficient way for each element of your pages.
c.	Tags are nested within each other correctly to create the desired result.
d.	Divs are used at the primary structural tags.
e.	The website uses Title and Meta tags.
f.	All pages are linked together with Hyperlinks.

Nature of Technology - Understand that technological outcomes are fit for purpose in terms of time and context. Understand the concept of malfunction and how “failure” can inform future outcomes.
You will complete a self and a peer evaluation sheet analysing your website against the following criteria:
Is my website easy to use/navigate?
Does the design match the product, Service or Event?
Am I happy with my website? If so why? If not, what would you change?







 
## Assessment Marking Schedule

Name	
Criterion A 
Outcome development - Analyse their own and others’ outcomes to inform the development of ideas for feasible outcomes

	Investigate	Task specific
E	Has comprehensively researched 3 unique websites.	You have provided in-depth evidence of research via: examining vastly different types of website, multiple webpage variants (specialised sub-pages), Identification and explanation of multiple key design concepts e.g. layout, types of CSS. Explaining design choices in relation to the product/target audience. 
M	Has thoroughly researched 3 unique websites.	You have provided evidence of research via: examining different types of website, Identification of several key design concepts that may have been used e.g. layout, types of CSS. Explaining design choices in relation to the product/target audience. 
A	Has researched 3 unique websites.	You have provided evidence of research via: examining 3 websites, Identification of key design concepts may have been completed e.g. Layout, but without detail. Explaining design choices in relation to the product/target audience. 
N	Has completed limited research.	You have provided evidence of some research via: examination of some websites, limited screenshots, Identification of how key design concepts may have been used. Design choices in relation to the product/target audience have not been identified or explained. This research is vague and/or you have not looked at a minimum of 3 websites. 


Criterion B
Technological Knowledge - Understand the properties of subsystems within technological systems.

	Plan	Task specific
E 	The student has created a High quality website that functions as intended.	The student with minimal guidance creates a high quality website that is “fit for purpose”. The websites design is an excellent match to the content. The page offers two language options in an easy to change way.

The HTML and CSS code has been implemented efficiently and clear understanding of tag relationships is evident due to the Website working as intended.
M	The student has created a quality website that largely functions as intended.	The student with minimal guidance creates a quality website that is “fit for purpose”. The websites design is a strong match to the content. The page offers two language options in an easy to change way.

The HTML and CSS code has been implemented mostly efficiently and sound understanding of tag relationships is evident due to the Website largely working as intended (One or two minor bugs may be apparent).
A	The student has created a website that functions, but may have design and/or coding errors. These errors affect usability. 	The student with some guidance creates a basic website that is “fit for purpose”. The websites design may match the content. The page offers two language options.

The HTML and CSS code has been implemented, but isn’t done in an efficient manner. Some understanding of tag relationships is evident due to the Website generally working as intended (Several bugs may be apparent).
NA	The website is unfinished and/or has many design and code issues that affect usability. 	The website is unfinished, or has many bugs that effect usability. 

 

Criterion c 
Nature of Technology - Understand that technological outcomes are fit for purpose in terms of time and context. Understand the concept of malfunction and how “failure” can inform future outcomes.

	Plan	Task specific
E	The student completes a compressive evaluation.	The student with minimal guidance completes a comprehensive evaluation of their website. This evaluation is honest and reflects on both the success and failures experienced during this project.
M	The student completes a detailed evaluation.	The student with minimal guidance completes a detailed evaluation of their website. This evaluation is honest and offers some reflection on both the success and failures experienced during this project.
A	The student completes an evaluation of their website.	The student with minimal guidance completes a basic evaluation of their website. This evaluation is honest and offers minimal reflection on both the success and failures experienced during this project.
NA	The student’s evaluation of their website is vague and demonstrates little reflection.	The student’s evaluation is vague and/or unfinished. They have not reflected on the website or how they developed it.
